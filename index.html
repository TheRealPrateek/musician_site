        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <article>
            Prateek (pruh - TEEK) has been described as “Not just any guy with a guitar…” by The Boston Globe and perhaps that’s the best introduction to his music besides actually listening to it. The Boston-based artist recorded his debut EP, “Walking in My Sleep,” with only his guitar and two microphones in an attempt to emulate Bob Dylan’s early work. Since then, Prateek’s music has evolved to incorporate gritty electric guitars, silvery backing vocals, and lush strings, all draped around his own soulful, powerful voice. Prateek has been a Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Finalist and has been nominated for Singer-Songwriter of the Year at both the New England Music Awards and the Boston Music Awards. His music has been played on radio stations including Sirius XM, 98.9 WERS, and 92.5 The River. His latest album, "‘Til June," is available wherever digital music is sold or streamed.

                “On his first full-length studio album ’Til June… he demonstrates his love and command of the breadth of Americana music by putting together a collection where nearly every track is a prime example of a different aspect of American roots music. Not since Mark Joseph’s 2021 release Vegas Motel have I been this surprised and charmed by every twist and turn of an album.” - Adventures in Americana

                “‘Til June is a potent combination of intelligent storytelling and an eclectic musical palette.” - Twangville

            <div>
                ““If You Want a Man”… switches tempos and time signatures… from a quieter folk sound to more of a rambling roots rocker and back to a honky tonk-influenced sound. This is a lot to pack in during four minutes, but Prateek executes it naturally and one can only imagine how a tune like this would keep a live audience on their toes as they eagerly waited to see where the band would go next. By the time the band gets to a blistering and twangy guitar solo intertwined with barroom boogie piano, it’s a full on party.” - Glide Magazine
